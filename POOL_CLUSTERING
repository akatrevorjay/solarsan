On bootup, wait up to 60s for other node to come online.
If node does not come online, proceed as if it's down.

Find out if other node is currently primary
If node is primary, export disks that are part of clustered pool and notify other node they are available, causing a resync (zpool clear and/or online)

If node is not primary, become primary
If other node is up, notify other node and wait for it to export it's disks and notify us that they are available

Import pool, do a clear/online to initiate a resync if it's needed.

Continue on as primary; export luns, shiz like that
